# Parallel-Distributed-Computing
Parallel and Distributed Computing - Assignments 1, 2 and 3
This repository contains the solutions for Assignments 2 and 3 of the Parallel and Distributed Computing (UCS645).

Assignment 2 - Questions
1. Estimate the value of Pi using the Monte Carlo method and demonstrate basic MPI functions.
2. Matrix Multiplication using MPI. Consider a 70x70 matrix, compute using serial sequential order, and compare the time.
3. Parallel Sorting using MPI (Odd-Even Sort).
4. Heat Distribution Simulation using MPI.
5. Parallel Reduction using MPI.
6. Parallel Dot Product using MPI.
7. Parallel Prefix Sum (Scan) using MPI.
8. Parallel Matrix Transposition using MPI.
   
Assignment 3 - Questions
1. DAXPY Loop
Perform the DAXPY operation X[i] = a * X[i] + Y[i] using MPI and measure the speedup compared to a uniprocessor implementation.
2. Calculation of π using MPI Bcast and MPI Reduce
Create a parallel MPI version to calculate the approximate value of π using MPI_Bcast and MPI_Reduce.
3. Prime Number Calculation using MPI
Implement a program to find all positive primes up to a maximum value using MPI_Recv for communication and a master-slave model for computation.
